# Project Overview
## Project Name
Real Time Bus Tracking
## Project Link

## Project Description
Check out this map for a bus route that tracks the latitude and longitude stops between MIT and Harvard using a marker. This project is useful to animate and track data from map APIs and callback timers to move the marker with just one click of a button. 
## Project Setup on Your Machine
To use this map, get started by cloning the repository in your IDE terminal and copy the HTTPS link from the green code button on my Github repo page. A Mapbox account might need to be created to get access to your individual token. 
## Project Improvement Opportunities
With my appreciation of maps, I hope to add more map features like estimated bus arrivals for specific stops and traffic heatmaps.
